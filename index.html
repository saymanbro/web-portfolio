            I have also shared a lot of useful courses and links in this article, but if you have to choose just one resource to start your journey on Web development, there is nothing better than The Web Developer Bootcamp online course by @ColtSteele on Udemy. This is simply an awesome resource and I keep looking back to the course even now.
